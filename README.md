## Welcome

I do not know GitHub very well.

**My ontological writings are my own words**. Philosophical thinking and similar really benefit from formulating things yourself — isn't it even crucial? — because it is when you push your intuition into formulated text of your own that you also know whether you know something or just think you do.

In programming, **I do outline the conceptual stuff myself**, and **I do design the larger projects myself**, but I use AI for boilerplate and stuff that would be too time-consuming. **I also like fresh air and outdoor activities**.

I feel all meaningful, deep, or extensive projects are way beyond what the AI can create. The AI is good for saving time, massively, in assisting with typical things.

**Why would git activity chart ever be an indicator of capability?** No one would call some productive for pressing ctrl+s... or am I missing something? In fact, insinuating ones git-chart means something, seem to indicate lesser awareness, as one doesn't seem aware it really isn't a chart of success.

### Guide for submissions

- If submitting anything, please, be aware I may hit the wrong buttons before getting experienced with GitHub.
- I haven't yet developed my github interaction style with regard to contributions, and don't know what that would be like.
- On the ontological things, I probably do not accept submissions, as it's meant be rooted in my views and struggle.

### Trivia

- With growing disappointment in each new release of Windows, I switched to Linux in 2023 and a year later decided to go all in.
- I installed and ran Slackware as early as 1999, later Red Hat, Gentoo, and LFS. I had some success but would only run it for shorter periods, only to revert to Windows. Recent versions of Windows disappointed me enough to completely give up on it.
- I found Arch Linux mostly by chance and discovered its minimalist philosophy suited me well, as it allowed me to select and configure the fundamental components myself. Selecting and evaluating each component made me realize the power of the terminal, whereby I built a terminal-centric environment. Thus, I run BSPWM, SXHKD, Tmux, Nvim, and Wezterm.
- My early programming centered around the desire to build my own text-adventure games and MUDs (a kind of text-based multiplayer adventure game). I didn't get very far, but I learned C that way. Later, I began working on web projects and gained experience with PHP.
- JavaScript is something I actively write today.
